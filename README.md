This project involves designing and delivering an insightful and visually engaging **Customer Retention Dashboard** for a telecom company's retention management team. The primary objective is to empower the team with a proactive approach to identify customers at risk of contract termination, enabling strategic interventions before churn occurs. The dashboard will serve as a self-explanatory tool for senior management, ensuring data-driven decisions for improving customer retention.

### Methods Used

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Obtained relevant customer data from the retention manager, including demographic, behavioral, and engagement metrics.
   - Cleaned and organized the data to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis and visualization.
   - Addressed missing or inconsistent values to enhance the reliability of insights.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted analysis to understand customer trends, identify potential churn indicators, and uncover key patterns.
   - Leveraged Python for statistical analysis and early feature identification.
   - Segmented customers based on risk levels and behavioral trends.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created new features such as churn probability scores, tenure buckets, and engagement rates to enrich the dataset.
   - Derived predictive insights by identifying correlations between customer behavior and termination likelihood.

4. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Developed a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression or random forest) to classify customers based on their risk of churn.
   - Fine-tuned model parameters to optimize accuracy and interpretability.

5. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Utilized **Power BI** to build a dynamic and interactive dashboard that integrates key retention metrics:
     - **Churn Risk Levels:** Visualization of customers categorized into low, medium, and high risk.
     - **Retention Insights:** A breakdown of factors contributing to churn likelihood.
     - **Engagement Metrics:** Tracking usage patterns and customer touchpoints.
     - **Demographic Analysis:** Visualizing customer profiles by age, location, or tenure.
   - Ensured user-friendly navigation with drill-down capabilities and actionable insights for retention strategies.

6. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - Collaborated closely with the Retention Manager and PwC engagement partner to align the dashboard features with business needs.
   - Incorporated feedback from stakeholders to refine the dashboardâ€™s functionality and usability.

7. **Presentation and Training:**
   - Presented the dashboard to the retention team and senior management, explaining its key features and insights.
   - Conducted training sessions to ensure the team could independently use and update the dashboard as required.

This solution transitions the retention team from a reactionary to a proactive strategy, supporting the telecom's broader goal of sustaining and improving customer loyalty.
